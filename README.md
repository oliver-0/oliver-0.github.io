# [Take-Home Pay Calculator](https://paycalculator.site "https://paycalculator.site")

Calculate your Take-Home Pay, taking into account Income Tax, Student Loan repayments and more.

## About

My first static site project, made with vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

The website calcuates your Take-Home Pay based on your Income and other inputs/modifiers, and shows the Output (Take-Home Pay) as a numerical value (yearly/monthly/weekly) with a Pie Chart breakdown.

It is based on a spreadsheet tool I built to calculate Take-Home Pay after Tax and Student Loans, to help with my budgeting.
